# Inject Response Template

Here is the inject response template that we'll be using. It's made in such a way that it should be easy to just put in the relevant information. 

## Reminders

1) These must be **PROFESSIONAL**. Be concise and careful when writing these. Do not use any slang, acronyms (unless previously defined).
2) Individuals working on the inject themselves, make sure you write your responses so that they are easy to digest and follow.
3) Work with technical writers to make sure that edge cases and potential questions are being answered.
4) Send to Chris **by** the 5 minute mark. The more time the better.
5) We need to submit **something** for these injects. 1 point > 0 points.
